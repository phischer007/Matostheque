# Matostheque

This repository is a **web-based application** tailored for members of the “Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire de Physique” at Université Grenoble Alpes. This system serves as a virtual material library, facilitating the sharing, lending, and borrowing of materials among users. Its primary goal is to streamline the management and accessibility of laboratory resources within the research community.

## Getting Started: 
1. Key Points

**Technical coverage**:
- **Backend architecture**: Describes the server-side infrastructure, outlining how data is managed and accessed through APIs.
- **Frontend Structure**: Details the client-side implementation, including user interfaces and interactions design.
2. Technology Stack

- **Database** : PostgreSQL database was selected for this project together with psycopg2, the PostgreSQL adapter for Python, using pip. It is a relational database management system (RDBMS). It provides robust features for managing structured data, ensuring data integrity, and supporting complex queries.
- **NodeJS**: Node.js serves as the runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side.
- **Node Package Manager**: npm manages dependencies and facilitates the integration of various libraries and tools into our project.
